# About Me üí¨

I'm a Full-Stack Engineer based out of Seattle who is incredibly passionate about working on software projects that challenge me beyond the limits of what I thought I could accomplish prior. I find the process of collaboration and learning new skills/tools to improve and build upon projects an immensely satisfying, fulfilling experience. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, I worked as a healthcare giver and housing case manager. Nowadays, I've returned to my passion, software and technology. Recently, I worked as a Software Project Manager for a real estate software company, Brivity, but have shifted back into software engineering.

On a more personal level, I have always been interested in software and tech from a young age, as many children growing up in the 2000s were. However, the "why" and "how" aspect of the tech I was interacting with intrigued me the most. Eventually, this led to my first attempt at modifying a video game, Half Life, at the age of 6. In all my wisdom at that age, I utterly destroyed those poor files and was perplexed when it would crash on startup... üòÖ Luckily, I have learned a lot since that that first modification and am now working on several modding projects across multiple Bethesda franchises such as The Elder Scrolls and the Fallout series.
