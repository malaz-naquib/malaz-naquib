# About Me üí¨

I'm an experienced Technical Program, Product, and Project Manager with a background in software engineering, currently heading software development at Career Study. In my free time, I teach full-stack development at 100Devs. Proven track record of leading the software development lifecycle on multiple large scale web projects. These web projects include scoping, developing, and pushing new features, bug fixes, various DevOps pipelines, cloud architecture, and 200+ websites, CRMs, and CMAs for top real estate teams internationally. Deep interest in AI and machine learning; bringing my skills to innovative tech companies with global reach.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, I worked as a healthcare giver and housing case manager; providing me insight into the importance of software in my role throughout the pandemic. Recently, I worked as a Software Project Manager for Brivity, a real estate software company building software for the top 1% of international real estate teams. In my current position as a Technical Project/Product Manager & Software Engineer at Career Study, I'm experienced in leading engineering teams to deliver exemplary, error-free web projects and products while also creating an uplifting, supportive work environment.

On a more personal level, I have always been interested in software and tech from a young age, as many children growing up in the 2000s were. However, the "why" and "how" aspects of the tech I interacted with intrigued me the most. Eventually, this led to my first attempt at modifying a video game, Half-Life, at the age of 6. In all my wisdom, I utterly destroyed those poor files and was bewildered when it would crash on startup... Luckily, I have learned a lot since that first modification and am now working on several modding projects across multiple Bethesda franchises such as The Elder Scrolls and the Fallout series!
