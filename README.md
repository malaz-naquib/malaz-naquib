### **Software Engineer [@100Devs](https://github.com/100devs) by day ‚òº video game modder by night ‚òæ**

# About Me üí¨

I am an incredibly passionate, experienced Software Engineer based out of Seattle, Washington. Currently, I'm performing full-stack development at 100Devs. With a proven track record of building 200+ websites, CRMs, and CMAs for the top 1% of international real estate teams, I'm always looking forward to working on software projects that showcase my skills while providing deep learning experiences. I find the process of collaborating and learning new skills/tools to improve and build upon software projects an immensely satisfying, fulfilling experience.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, I worked as a healthcare giver and housing case manager; providing me insight into the importance of software in my role throughout the pandemic. Recently, I worked as a Software Project Manager for Brivity, a real estate software company building software for the top 1% of international real estate teams. As of now, I have fully shifted back into my life-long passion, software engineering. Currently, I am seeking to bring my skills to an innovative tech company with global reach.

On a more personal level, I have always been interested in software and tech from a young age, as many children growing up in the 2000s were. However, the "why" and "how" aspects of the tech I interacted with intrigued me the most. Eventually, this led to my first attempt at modifying a video game, Half-Life, at the age of 6. In all my wisdom, I utterly destroyed those poor files and was bewildered when it would crash on startup... Luckily, I have learned a lot since that first modification and am now working on several modding projects across multiple Bethesda franchises such as The Elder Scrolls and the Fallout series!
